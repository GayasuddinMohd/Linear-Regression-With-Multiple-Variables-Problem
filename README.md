# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It's a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, commonly employed for various purposes such as prediction, correlation analysis, and understanding the relationships between variables.

In its simplest form, linear regression deals with a single independent variable, often referred to as the "predictor" or "feature," and a single dependent variable, also known as the "response" or "target." The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This linear relationship is expressed through an equation of the form:

y=mx+b

Where:

* y is the dependent variable (response).
* x is the independent variable (predictor).
* m represents the slope of the line, indicating the change in y for a unit change in x.
* b is the y-intercept, representing the value of y when x is zero.
 
Linear regression can be used for both simple relationships, where there's only one independent variable, and multiple regression, where there are multiple independent variables. It's important to note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables, which might not always hold true in real-world scenarios. Additionally, it's sensitive to outliers and assumptions like homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals) and normality of residuals.

In practice, linear regression is widely used in fields such as economics, social sciences, engineering, and machine learning. It serves as a building block for more complex regression techniques and machine learning algorithms, and it's often used as a baseline model for comparison.

# Linear Regression With Multiple Variables 

Linear regression with multiple variables, also known as multiple linear regression, extends the concept of simple linear regression to situations where there are more than one independent variable influencing the dependent variable. This allows for a more comprehensive model that can capture the relationships between multiple predictors and the target variable.

# Uses

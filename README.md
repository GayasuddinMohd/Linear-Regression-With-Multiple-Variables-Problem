# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It's a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, commonly employed for various purposes such as prediction, correlation analysis, and understanding the relationships between variables.

In its simplest form, linear regression deals with a single independent variable, often referred to as the "predictor" or "feature," and a single dependent variable, also known as the "response" or "target." The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This linear relationship is expressed through an equation of the form:
